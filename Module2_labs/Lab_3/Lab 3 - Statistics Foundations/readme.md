Part 1


Challenge 1
Find a and b, if median=42, mean=50 20,34, 34, 12, 56, 110, 49, a, b.
A = 42
B = 153



Challenge 2
A car hit an average speed of v1 = 60 kmph in the first half of the journey, and hit an average speed of v2 = 110 kmph in the second half of the journey. Determine the average speed of the car.
 
(60x+110x)/2x =85x 

Example:
1st half of the journey:
1h – 60km
12h – 12 *60 =720km

2nd half the journey:
1h – 110km
12h – 12 *110 =1320km

AVG = (720+1320)/24 = 85kmph


Challenge 3
The lifetimes of 400 light-bulbs were found to the nearest hour. The results were recorded as follows. Lifetime (hours) 0–199 200–399 400–599 600–799 800–999 1000–1199 1200–1999 Frequency 143 97 64 51 14 14 17 Construct a histogram and cumulative frequency polygon for this dataset. Estimate the percentage of bulbs with lifetime less than 480 hours.
