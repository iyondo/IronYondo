Part 1


Challenge 1
Find a and b, if median=42, mean=50 20,34, 34, 12, 56, 110, 49, a, b.
A = 42
B = 153



Challenge 2
A car hit an average speed of v1 = 60 kmph in the first half of the journey, and hit an average speed of v2 = 110 kmph in the second half of the journey. Determine the average speed of the car.
 
(60x+110x)/2x =85x 

Example:
1st half of the journey:
1h – 60km
12h – 12 *60 =720km

2nd half the journey:
1h – 110km
12h – 12 *110 =1320km

AVG = (720+1320)/24 = 85kmph
